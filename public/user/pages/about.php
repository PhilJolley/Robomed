    <h2><strong>What is Robomed?</strong></h2>
    <p id = "indent">The Robomed Network is a revolutionary way to access healthcare for people who wish to pay out of pocket. Robomed greatly reduces costs associated with health care by allowing doctors and clinics to securely manage treatment, patient documents, payment, patient outcomes, and much more without unnecessary third parties. By using blockchain smart contract technology, Robomed will not only make health care significantly less expensive, it will also greatly improve the standard of care; especially for those in developing countries. By ensuring healthcare providers use protocols  like ICHOM (The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement), a non-profit organization based out of Harvard University, patients using the Robomed system are cared for using only the best world practices. No matter where you are in the world, if you are using the Robomed network, you only pay when the best medical practices have been followed!
</p><br>
    <h2><strong>What is an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and why is Robomed offering RBM.</strong></h2>
    <p id = "indent">An Initial Coin Offering is similar to an Initial Public Offering but instead of issuing stocks or bonds, an ICO is a way to raise funds by exchanging cryptocurrency for a new digital currency. Robomed is exchanging Ethereum (ETH), a cryptocurrency that utilizes smart contracts, for its new Ethereum based currency (RBM).</p><br>
    <p id = "indent">RBM will be used by the Robomed Network as payment for health care. This allows for people anywhere around the world to get the care they need by simply purchasing a smart contract for health services, on a computer or a mobile device. Because RBM is an Ethereum based currency with smart contracts, the Robomed Network can autonomously perform many functions where modern healthcare systems are extremely inefficient. The Robomed Network uses RBM alongside blockchain smart contract technology to automatically pay the healthcare provider if and only when patientâ€™s smart contract is complete.</p><br>
    <h2><strong>What is a smart contract and how are they used in the Robomed Network?</strong></h2>
    <p id = "indent">Think of a smart contract as a program created to execute exactly what it was designed to do without the possibility of downtime or interference by a third party. In the simplest terms, a smart contract is a coded contract that executes only if the terms of the agreement have been reached. No one can change the code after the parameters of the contract have been established and the smart contract has been initiated. If multiple smart contracts are combined they can be used to create a chain of agreements, each individual smart contract initiating the next, that can autonomously carry out varying procedures; diminishing the need for bureaucrats, lawyers, banks, and countless inefficiencies in the current system for healthcare.</p><br>
    <p id = "indent">Smart contracts in the Robomed Network are programmed to follow standardized medical procedures created by ICHOM. Because the standard of care varies hugely from place to place the Robomed Network ensures that healthcare providers treat patients according to protocol and guidelines set in the smart contract. If the healthcare provider does not follow the protocol they will not receive payment, the patient will be reimbursed, and the contract will be reviewed by specialists.
