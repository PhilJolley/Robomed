This is based off of a framework that I created. It has two sets of folders: 1. Is what I need and created for the customers both frontend and backend. 2. I have created a section that is for admin. Here I am using a Login system that I forked from subins2000/logSys. 

This is a fun project I have worked on. It has a lot to build off of. 

Follow, Fork, and Comment.
